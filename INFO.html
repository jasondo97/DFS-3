  <p1>I am a creative and dedicated individual with a passion for fashion, marketing, and UI-UX design. I'm currently an Interaction Design student from Emily Carr University of Art + Design and holding a Diploma in Fashion Merchandising from LaSalle College Vancouver. I enjoy combining my design knowledge with strategic business skills to help brands grow and connect with their audiences.

I have a knack for developing and executing marketing strategies that lead to increased revenue and brand visibility. I love creating engaging content and designing visual merchandising that captures the audience’s attention and enhances their experience.

My work has been recognized with awards such as Runner-up in the Ô-Photography contest by L'OFFICIEL Vietnam and Champion at the Flui Hackathon. I am proficient in tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and HTML/CSS, and I’m fluent in English and Vietnamese, which helps me communicate effectively with diverse audiences.

I’m always eager to learn and explore new opportunities in the fashion and design industry, and I’m excited about collaborating with others to create innovative and impactful solutions."</p1>
